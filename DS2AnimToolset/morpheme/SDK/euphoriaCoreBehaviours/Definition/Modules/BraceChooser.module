// this module takes care of choosing which leg(s) to brace with
// based on which one is closer. It is designed to work on n legs and the result depends on the masses 
// a character with heavy legs and a small body mass will brace with just the closest leg
// a character with light legs and a heavy body will usually brace with all its legs
// This module could also be used for arms, and for deciding which legs to step with
// Lastly, there is scope to improve this by shanging how the incoming data is calculated
