RADAI'S NOTE
============================================
This runtime distribution is modified. It's tweaked to load and process Dark Souls II morpheme binaries (tested on 64 bits only, but should work for 32 too).

Welcome to the Morpheme Runtime distribution
============================================

The documentation for the product is located in the docs sub-folder.
 * For information on what has changed in this version, refer to CHANGES.txt.
 * For details on how these changes may affect your use of morpheme, please refer to UPGRADE.txt

To get started with looking at and building code there are some key locations where Visual Studio solutions (and build files for other platforms) are located:

  - morpheme/samples/tutorials
  - morpheme/tools/assetCompiler
  - morpheme/tools/runtimeTarget

The basic contents of this distribution are as follows:
